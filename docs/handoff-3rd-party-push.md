## Read this first

This is a **UX and functionality prototype**, not a partial implementation. There is no
backend and no real authentication — all state lives in the browser (localStorage), and
every external call (advertiser lookup, push) is **simulated**. Its job is to pin down the
intended behavior and screens so the team can scope and build the real thing. Each feature
below is split into *what the prototype does* vs. *what production needs to own*.

Stack: React + TypeScript + MUI. Runs at `localhost:5174` (`npm run dev`).

## Foundations (shared)

- **Two status lifecycles.** Every distribution tag carries **two independent statuses**,
  one column each: **Platform Status** (this doc) and **Transcode Status** (the Transcoding
  doc). A tag can be transcoded and live yet never pushed — or pushed and rejected.
- **Platform, not DSP.** Today a platform means a **DSP** (Nexxen, The Trade Desk); the
  naming deliberately spans **DSP and SSP** so supply-side targets fit later without renaming.
- **Readability.** Each status renders as a colored dot *and* a label; same-hue states are
  told apart by a **ring vs. solid** dot.
- **Prototype affordance to ignore in production:** each row's `⋯` menu has a "Set platform
  status" block so a reviewer can force any state (e.g. show an error) during a walkthrough.
  It disappears once the real push API drives status.

## Feature inventory

Everything the 3rd-Party Push track adds, at a glance — each is detailed in the sections
below.

**Pushing tags**
- **Push Tags to Platform** dialog — pick a platform + advertiser, choose which tags, push.
- **Platform-drives-selection** — choosing a platform auto-selects that platform's tags and
  disables the rest; switching platforms swaps the selection.
- **family→platform lock** — a tag can only be pushed to the platform it was built for (its
  `family`); one push targets exactly one platform.
- **Partial push** — uncheck any of a platform's tags before pushing; a live "N of M selected"
  count and a count-aware button (`Push 3 Tags`).
- **Add + Push / Save + Push** — push straight from the tag editor (in both create and edit
  mode), opening the flow pre-scoped to that tag's platform + that one tag.

**Advertiser model**
- **Platform-scoped advertisers** — each platform returns its own advertiser set; the
  advertiser dropdown is dependent on the platform (platform must be chosen first).
- **Name + ID display** — `Advertiser 1 · 012345` (ID format is a placeholder).
- **One advertiser per platform, locked** — the first push sets it; after that the field is
  **disabled** (not just read-only), greyed, with a **lock icon** + a *contact support*
  tooltip. Each platform keeps its own.
- **Lock announced before it's set** — an inline notice on selecting an advertiser, plus a
  confirmation on the first push, both in intentionally generic copy.
- **Async load with a stale-response guard** so a slow reply can't overwrite a newer
  platform's list.

**Platform Status (per distro)**
- A dedicated **Platform Status** column, fully independent of Transcode Status, rendered by
  the shared `StatusChip`.
- Five states — Not pushed / Pushing / Success / Error / Inactive — with the chip naming the
  destination (`Success: Nexxen`).
- **Link / Unlink row icon** — unlink a Success tag → Inactive (keeps the target); relink an
  Inactive/Error tag → Success. Both **confirm first**.

**Prototype-only affordances (gone in production)**
- `⋯` menu "Set platform status" block to force any state during a walkthrough.
- Optimistic push (always lands Success) and mocked advertiser lists.

## What it does

**Push Tags to Platform** (button in the Distributions section, disabled until at least one
tag exists) opens a dialog to choose a destination and exactly which tags to send.

- Advertisers are **scoped to the platform** — each platform returns its own set — so the
  platform must be chosen before the advertiser field enables.
- Each advertiser shows as **name + advertiser ID** — e.g. `Advertiser 1 · 012345`. *(The ID
  format is a placeholder; the real format is TBD.)*
- **One advertiser per platform, locked:** the **first** push to a platform sets its
  advertiser; every push after that **reuses it and the advertiser field is disabled** — not
  merely read-only. The field greys out, a **lock icon** sits at its right edge, and hovering
  it shows *"This advertiser is locked. Contact support to change the advertiser for this
  platform."* Each platform keeps its own (Nexxen and TTD independently). Rationale: linking a
  platform + advertiser is non-trivial on the backend, so a line-item shouldn't let the
  advertiser churn — changing it is deliberately a support operation, not a self-serve control.
  *(In the prototype there's no in-app way to change a locked advertiser — clearing demo state
  resets it.)*
- **The lock is made explicit before it happens.** Because that first push is what sets the
  lock, the user is told twice: an **inline notice** appears under the advertiser field the
  moment an advertiser is chosen (before it's locked), and the first push raises a
  **confirmation** — *"Lock the advertiser for this platform?"* — spelling out that assigning
  an advertiser locks it to every distribution on this platform for this line item, now and for
  any added later, while other platforms keep their own and a new line item is set up
  separately. Later pushes reuse the locked advertiser silently. **The copy is intentionally
  generic** (no advertiser or platform name interpolated) so it never has to be generated
  per-platform.
- The advertiser list loads **asynchronously** with a spinner, and a stale-response guard
  keeps a slow reply from overwriting a newer platform's list.

## A tag can only go to its own platform

A tag is **built for one platform** — its `family` (Nexxen or TTD today) — and can only be
pushed there: a Nexxen tag → Nexxen, a TTD tag → The Trade Desk. One push targets a single
platform, and the platform **drives the selection**:

- The **platform picker always lists every platform** — the user can switch to any of them at
  any time.
- **Choosing a platform auto-selects that platform's tags** and disables the rest. Pick
  Nexxen and every Nexxen tag is checked, ready to push; switch to The Trade Desk and the
  selection swaps to the TTD tags. The user can still uncheck individual tags for a partial
  push.

So a distro list mixing Nexxen + TTD (+ future platforms) needs no manual sorting — the user
just picks the platform and pushes, then picks the next and pushes those. The mapping is a
direct lookup, so future platforms are covered as their family is added.

> In the prototype every tag is a Nexxen or TTD tag, so the platform options are exactly those
> two. **In the final version, tags sync with the platforms (DSPs / SSPs / etc.) directly** —
> the family→platform lock is the prototype stand-in for that sync. Users can still add
> custom key-values / macros regardless.

## Choosing what to push

- Until a platform is chosen, **nothing is selected** — the checklist prompts "Pick a platform
  to select its tags." Choosing one selects that platform's tags automatically.
- The dialog lists every tag with a checkbox; each row shows its **platform + current platform
  status**, and — for a tag already pushed — the **advertiser + ID it was last assigned to**
  (`Advertiser 1 · 012345`). So a user can see what's already gone out and where. Tags that
  don't belong to the chosen platform are disabled.
- A select-all toggle and a live "3 of 6 Nexxen tags selected" count cover the chosen
  platform's tags. The push button reflects the count — `Push 3 Tags` — and stays disabled
  until a platform, an advertiser, and at least one tag are selected.

## Add + Push / Save + Push (from the tag editor)

The tag editor has a **push button in both modes**, so a tag can be pushed the moment it's
created *or* any time afterward:

- **Add mode:** alongside **Add**, there's **Add + Push**.
- **Edit mode:** alongside **Save**, there's **Save + Push** — this closes the gap where a tag
  added without pushing had no easy per-tag push later.

Either one saves the tag, then opens the push flow **pre-scoped**: the platform is **locked to
the tag's family** (a Nexxen tag opens push locked to Nexxen) and that one tag is pre-selected.
With the sticky advertiser (above), the advertiser is often pre-filled too — so it can be a
single confirm.

## Platform Status — the states

| State | Color | Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Not pushed** | Grey **ring** | Never pushed to a platform (default for a new tag). |
| **Pushing** | Amber | Push in flight. |
| **Success** | Green | The platform accepted the tag. Chip names the destination — `Success: Nexxen`. |
| **Error** | Red | The push failed **or** the platform rejected the tag. |
| **Inactive** | Grey | Was linked to a platform, then **unlinked**. Chip keeps the platform — `Inactive: Nexxen`. |

On push, the selected tags go **Pushing**, then land **Success**, with the destination
recorded per tag (from the platform + advertiser chosen).

**Unlink / Link.** Each distro row has a **link/unlink icon** in its actions (right of the
transcode restart icon). The icon reflects **state**, and clicking it toggles:

- **Success** → **link-on** icon (actively linked) → click **unlinks** → **Inactive** (push
  target kept, so the chip reads `Inactive: Nexxen`).
- **Inactive** or **Error** → **link-off** icon (unlinked) → click **relinks** to the
  remembered platform → **Success**.
- **Not pushed / Pushing** → disabled (link-off, nothing to toggle).

**Both unlink and re-link ask for confirmation first** — they change the platform connection,
which shouldn't happen by accident (transcode restart is guarded the same way). The prompts are
generic ("…for this distribution?"), not platform-specific.

## In the prototype vs. For production

| In the prototype | For production |
|---|---|
| Advertiser lists are **mocked** — a fixed "Advertiser 1–10" per platform, with simulated latency. | Real **per-platform advertiser API** (each platform authenticated independently). |
| Pushing is **optimistic**: every push lands Success. No request leaves the browser. | Real **push API** returning success / error / rejection — the UI already models `pushing → success/error`. |
| Error/rejection shown only via the `⋯` "Set platform status" affordance. | Surface **rejection reasons** and a retry path on Error. |
| Only the **last** push target + status is kept per tag. | Persist **push history** (platform, advertiser, timestamp, outcome). |

## Implementation map (for the build team)

Where each piece lives today. All state is a single `useReducer` in
[`../src/state/AppContext.tsx`](../src/state/AppContext.tsx), persisted to `localStorage`
(`radius.adtags.v1`); components call helpers off `useApp()` and never `dispatch` directly.
Domain logic in `src/lib/` is pure (no React imports).

**Types** ([`../src/types.ts`](../src/types.ts))
- `PlatformStatus = "notPushed" | "pushing" | "success" | "error" | "inactive"`.
- `Distro.platformStatus: PlatformStatus` — the per-distro status.
- `Distro.pushTarget?: { platform; advertiser; advertiserId? }` — the last destination; drives
  the chip suffix (`Success: Nexxen`) and the relink action.
- `AppState.platformAdvertisers: Record<platformId, { id; name; advertiserId }>` — the locked
  advertiser per platform (the "one advertiser per platform" rule).

**Domain logic**
- [`../src/lib/pushTargets.ts`](../src/lib/pushTargets.ts) — `PUSH_PLATFORMS`,
  `platformForFamily(family)`, `PlatformAdvertiser`, and `fetchPlatformAdvertisers(platformId)`
  (mock async — **the swap point for the real per-platform advertiser API**).
- [`../src/lib/platformStatus.ts`](../src/lib/platformStatus.ts) — `PLATFORM_STATUS_META`
  (dot color / label / description per state), `PLATFORM_STATUS_ORDER`,
  `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_STATUS`.

**State / reducer** ([`../src/state/AppContext.tsx`](../src/state/AppContext.tsx))
- `setDistrosPlatformStatus(ids, status, target?)` — bulk-set status and record the target.
- `rememberPlatformAdvertiser(platformId, advertiser)` — sets the locked advertiser (first push
  only). Persisted under `platformAdvertisers`.

**Components**
- [`../src/components/PushTagsDialog.tsx`](../src/components/PushTagsDialog.tsx) — the push
  dialog: platform-drives-selection, the disabled+locked advertiser field (lock icon + tooltip),
  the stale-guarded advertiser fetch.
- [`../src/components/DistroTable.tsx`](../src/components/DistroTable.tsx) — the Platform Status
  column and the link/unlink row icon (state → icon, confirm → toggle).
- [`../src/components/DistrosSection.tsx`](../src/components/DistrosSection.tsx) — `handlePush`,
  `handleUnlinkPlatform`, `handleRelinkPlatform`.
- [`../src/components/TagEditorDialog.tsx`](../src/components/TagEditorDialog.tsx) — Add + Push /
  Save + Push (via the `onAndPush` callback).
- [`../src/components/StatusChip.tsx`](../src/components/StatusChip.tsx) — the shared
  dot + label + suffix chip (also used by Transcode Status).

**Backend swap points**
1. `fetchPlatformAdvertisers` → the real advertiser API (per-platform, independently authed).
2. `handlePush`'s optimistic `pushing → success` → the real push API returning
   success / error / rejection. The UI already models `pushing → success/error`, so only the
   data source changes.
3. Add **push-history** persistence — today only the last target + status is kept per distro.

## Open questions for the team

1. **Do SSPs use "advertisers," or a different association?** Supply-side may bind to a
   publisher or seat instead. If so, the second dropdown's *label* becomes platform-dependent,
   and the advertiser API needs to return the field name alongside the list.
2. **Should transcode state gate a push?** Right now any tag is pushable regardless of its
   transcode status. Should a non-Live tag (still processing, or errored) be blocked or warned
   before it can be pushed?
3. **Re-push semantics.** What happens when a tag already Successful is pushed again —
   overwrite, version, or no-op?

## Walkthrough

1. **Add distribution tags** — Distributions → *+ Add Distribution Tag*, choosing the **Nexxen**
   or **TTD** tab. Each appears with a `Not pushed` Platform Status.
2. **Add + Push** — while adding a Nexxen tag, click **Add + Push**. The push dialog opens with
   the platform **locked to Nexxen** and the new tag pre-selected; pick an advertiser and push.
3. **Platform drives the selection** — with a mix of Nexxen and TTD tags, open *Push Tags to
   Platform*, pick **Nexxen** → all Nexxen tags auto-select (TTD disabled) → push; then pick
   **The Trade Desk** → the selection swaps to the TTD tags → push those.
4. **Push just some** — after picking a platform, uncheck any of its tags you want to hold back
   before pushing.
5. **Show a rejection** — use a row's `⋯` menu to force **Error** on the platform status.

## Known limitations & not-yet-built

- No backend or real auth; all data is in the browser and resets if localStorage is cleared.
- Advertiser lookup and push are simulated (timers + mock data); no request leaves the browser.
- No push history and no retry/rejection-reason UI yet — both flagged above as production work.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-13** — **Advertiser lock is now announced before it's set.** Choosing an advertiser
  shows an inline notice, and the first push raises a confirmation, both making clear that the
  advertiser locks to every distribution on that platform for the line item. The copy is
  intentionally generic (no advertiser/platform name interpolated).
- **2026-08-13** — **Expanded for the build team.** Added a **Feature inventory** (every
  unique behavior at a glance) and an **Implementation map** (types, domain logic, state
  actions, components, and the backend swap points). No behavior change — documentation only.
- **2026-08-03** — **Locked advertiser is now fully disabled.** Once an advertiser is set for a
  platform, the field is **disabled** (not just read-only), with a **lock icon** and a tooltip
  directing the user to **contact support** to change it — making clear it's a support
  operation, not a self-serve control.
- **2026-08-03** — **Unlink and re-link now confirm.** Both platform-link toggles ask for
  confirmation first (generic prompts), paired with the same guard on transcode restart —
  guarding against accidental changes to a platform connection.
- **2026-08-03** — **One advertiser per platform, locked.** The first push to a platform sets
  its advertiser; further pushes reuse it with the field locked (no changing it — the backend
  linking is non-trivial). Each platform keeps its own. (Confirmed by product review.)
- **2026-08-03** — Tag editor's push button now works in **edit mode** too (**Save + Push**),
  so a tag added without pushing can be pushed later without the bulk dialog.
- **2026-08-03** — Added an **Inactive** platform status and a **link/unlink toggle**, exposed
  as an **icon** in each distro's row actions (right of the restart icon). The icon reflects
  state: **link-on** for Success (click unlinks → Inactive), **link-off** for Inactive/Error
  (click relinks → Success), disabled for Not pushed / Pushing.
- **2026-07-31** — Advertisers now show **name + advertiser ID** (`Advertiser 1 · 012345`;
  ID format is a placeholder). The push dialog's tag list also shows the **advertiser + ID
  each already-pushed tag is assigned to**.
- **2026-07-30** — Fixed **Add + Push** showing "No options" for advertisers: the advertiser
  fetch now also refires when the dialog opens (not only on platform change), so a pre-locked
  platform loads its advertisers even when it matches the previously-used platform.
- **2026-07-30** — Reworked the push editor to a **platform-drives-selection** model: the
  platform picker always lists every platform, and choosing one auto-selects that platform's
  tags (disabling the rest) so a mixed Nexxen+TTD list needs no manual sorting. Replaces the
  bidirectional lock (which limited the dropdown by the selection).
- **2026-07-29** — Added the family→platform push lock (a tag can only be pushed to the
  platform it was built for) and the **Add + Push** button in the tag editor (creates the tag
  and opens push pre-scoped, platform locked to the tag's family). Made the main push editor's
  lock **bidirectional** — selecting tags now limits the platform picker to their platform,
  not just the reverse. Noted that tags will sync with platforms directly in the final version.
- **2026-07-28** — Initial hand-off. Split out from the combined overview.
